•	How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

In the CRUD Python module from Project One, this meant separating database operations; such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting records; into their own functions rather than embedding SQL logic directly inside dashboard widgets or interface code. Working this way had several advantages in Project Two. Because all the database interactions were centralized in one module, the dashboard components merely had to call those functions, making the visual interface easier to build and reducing the chance of redundant or inconsistent database code. This approach also made debugging much simpler; if something went wrong with data retrieval or formatting, the issue could be traced to one place rather than searching through several different scripts. Looking ahead, the CRUD module could be reused in other projects that need access to the same dataset or expanded to support new queries without modifying the dashboard itself, which demonstrates how modular design supports long term adaptability.


•	How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

Approaching problems as a computer scientist means breaking them down into smaller, well defined pieces and identifying the logical structure of each part. For the Grazioso Salvare project, this meant analyzing the client’s requirements—such as identifying specific dog attributes or filtering for particular rescue capabilities—and mapping those requirements to database structures and user interface elements. Unlike earlier assignments where tasks were isolated or purely theoretical, this project simulated a real client scenario that required integrating database design, Python development, and dashboard visualization into a cohesive system. Techniques such as entity relationship modeling, iterative refinement, and modular programming were essential. In future projects, I would continue using these strategies, along with practices like writing clear documentation, normalizing database tables, and developing reusable modules to ensure that systems can easily evolve as client needs change.


•	What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists solve problems by designing systems that manage, analyze, and present information in meaningful ways—and this work matters because nearly every modern organization depends on accurate, accessible data. For a company like Grazioso Salvare, the project’s database and dashboard tools make it far easier to identify dogs with specific training or behavioral characteristics. Instead of manually searching through records, staff can instantly sort and filter data to find animals suited for search and rescue tasks. This increases efficiency, reduces errors, and ultimately helps the organization deploy resources more effectively. By building tools that transform raw data into actionable insights, a computer scientist directly supports a company’s mission and improves the quality and speed of its decision making.
